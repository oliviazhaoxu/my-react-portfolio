          <p>Born and raised in Sichuan, China, I was the only child of two factory workers. Neither of my parents went to university, but they raised me on a varied diet of feminist books and punk music, mainly by free-range parenting. I became a liberal and adventurous person, and found my true calling in journalism.</p>
          <p>As a young kid I was drawn to crime fictions and detective stories. Filled with a burning desire to just <i>know</i>, I followed Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle as they unraveled one mystery after another with their words. Later I discovered podcasts, and immediately fell under the spell of true crime and long-form investigation.</p>
          <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree at the Graduate School of Journalism, UC Berkeley.</p>
